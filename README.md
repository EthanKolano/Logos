I'll give a brief description of each file here cuz like yeah

Logo (vector) - 
The SVG (Scalable vector graphic) is a vector render of the logo so it can be infinitely upscaled or downscaled and won't (hopefully) lose any detail or become pixelated.
It is a little bit harder to work with however, but I thought it would be nice to have. 

The bitmap file is a tranparent png so it wont have a background, if you need it for something let me know because it's probably not the highest quality I just thought it
might be useful for something. I can probably fix any imperfections if you need.

Theres the simple jpeg there as well, although jpegs are usually not the highest quality.

Enhanced - 
Also theres a regular png which (might) be a bit higher quality? Who knows.
